Generation scheme:

{
    "scheme": "Decompose into Key Poses",
    "reason": "Playing the violin involves intricate and varied movements of the arms, hands, and fingers, as well as subtle body movements for expression. The character's pose changes significantly as they move the bow across the strings and finger different positions. Therefore, decomposing the motion into key poses will allow for capturing the nuances and dynamics of violin playing.",
    "choice": 1

Transform for whole body:
====================================
[
    {"time":"0.0s","body transform":"The person stands upright, holding the violin in front of them with their left hand on the neck and right hand on the bow, ready to play"},
    {"time":"1.0s","body transform":"They lift the violin slightly and bring the bow in contact with the strings, starting to play. The body leans forward slightly, with a slight tilt to the left, following the movement of the bow"},
    {"time":"2.0s","body transform":"The person continues playing, moving the bow across the strings with a smooth, continuous motion. The body remains tilted to the left, and the right arm moves back and forth in a controlled manner"},
    {"time":"3.0s","body transform":"As they play a more intricate passage, the person may shift their body weight slightly, moving forward and backward in small increments to maintain balance and coordination. The left hand fingers press down on the strings, creating different notes"},
    {"time":"4.0s","body transform":"Approaching the end of the musical phrase, the person might prepare for a more dramatic expression. They could straighten their body, creating a brief pause, and then lean into the final notes, tilting slightly to the right for emphasis"}
